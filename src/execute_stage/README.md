# Execute Stage â€“ RV32IM 5-Stage Processor

This folder contains the implementation of the **Execute (EX) stage** for the RV32IM 5-stage pipelined processor.
The EX stage performs **arithmetic, logical, and branch calculations**, selects ALU operands, handles forwarding, and calculates jump/branch target addresses.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

* **execute_stage.v** â€“ Top-level EX stage connecting ALU, ALU controller, forwarding logic, and PC/jump calculation.
* **alu.v** â€“ Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performing signed/unsigned operations, comparisons, and shifts.
* **alu_control.v** â€“ Generates ALU control signals based on opcode, func3, and func7 fields.
* **pc_jump.v** â€“ Computes branch and jump target addresses, evaluates branch conditions, and signals BTB updates.
* **README.md** â€“ This documentation file.
---

## ðŸš€ Features

* **Operand forwarding** from MEM/WB stages to prevent data hazards
* **ALU operations**: add, sub, AND, OR, XOR, shifts, SLT/SLTU
* **Branch/jump calculation** with support for predictedTaken signals
* **Flush support**: on pipeline flush, ALU operands are forced to zero, preventing invalid computation
* **M-unit integration**: outputs from multiplication/division unit are passed when they are ready
* **Write-back control**: selects correct destination register and enables register file write

## ðŸ“Œ Key Design Points

1. **Operand Forwarding**

   * Operand A and B can be forwarded from **EX/MEM** or **MEM/WB** pipeline stages.
   * Prevents data hazards without stalling the pipeline.
   * Forwarding control signals `operand_a_forward_cntl` and `operand_b_forward_cntl` determine the source of operands for the ALU.

2. **ALU Operand Selection**

   * Operand 1 (`op1_alu`) and Operand 2 (`op2_alu`) are selected based on instruction type:

     * I-type: immediate used for Operand 2
     * JAL/JALR: Operand 1 = PC, Operand 2 = 4
     * U-type/AUIPC: Operand 1 = 0/PC, Operand 2 = immediate
     * Other instructions: Operand 1/2 taken from register file or forwarded data
   * On a **pipeline flush**, operands are set to 0 to avoid invalid operations.

3. **Branch & Jump Handling**

   * Branch and jump addresses are calculated in EX stage using `pc_jump` module.
   * Conditional branches use ALU flags (`lt_flag`, `ltu_flag`, `zero_flag`) to determine if the branch is taken.
   * Jumps and branches generate `jump_en` and `update_btb` signals to guide the fetch stage and update the Branch Target Buffer.

4. **M-unit Integration**

   * When a multiplication/division (M-unit) result is ready, it overrides the ALU output.
   * Write-back signals (`wb_reg_file`, `wb_rd`) are updated to reflect M-unit output.

5. **Write-back Selection**

   * `wb_reg_file` determines if the destination register should be written.
   * `wb_rd` indicates the target register.
   * Ensures correct values are forwarded or written back even during flushes or M-unit results.
