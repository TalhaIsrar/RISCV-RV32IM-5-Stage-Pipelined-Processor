# Decode Stage Module

This folder contains the implementation of the **Instruction Decode (ID) stage** for the RV32IM 5-stage pipelined processor.
The ID stage is responsible for **decoding instructions**, **generating control signals**, **reading operands from the register file**, and **calculating immediates**.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

* **decode_stage.v**
  Top-level RTL Verilog file implementing the decode stage.

* **decode_controller.v**
  Control logic for generating ALU, memory, and writeback signals based on the instruction.

* **register_file.v**
  Synchronous 32x32 register file with writeback forwarding and hardwired x0.

* **README.md**
  This documentation file.

## ðŸš€ Features

* Decodes RISC-V instructions (R/I/S/B/U/J types) and extracts opcode, func3, func7, rs1, rs2, rd.
* Computes **immediate values** for different instruction formats.
* Generates control signals:

  * `alu_src` â†’ selects ALU operand
  * `mem_write` / `mem_load_type` / `mem_store_type` â†’ memory access
  * `wb_load` / `wb_reg_file` â†’ writeback control
  * `invalid_inst` â†’ flags unrecognized instructions
  * `m_type_inst` â†’ identifies multiplication/division instructions
* Provides **operand forwarding** from writeback stage to prevent RAW hazards.
* x0 is **hardwired to 0**.

### Behavior

* **Immediate Generator:** Creates sign-extended immediate values for different instruction types (I/S/B/U/J).
* **Controller:** Produces control signals based on opcode, func3, func7.
* **Register File:** Reads operands (`op1`, `op2`) and supports writeback forwarding.
* **Instruction Flush:** Converts instruction to NOP if pipeline flush is requested.

```verilog
assign instruction = id_flush ? 32'h00000013 : instruction_in;
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

* Flush logic converts instructions to NOP to prevent hazards.
* Compatible with 5-stage RV32IM pipeline design.
