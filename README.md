# RV32IM 5-Stage Pipelined Processor

This repository contains the implementation and verification of a RISC-V RV32IM processor with a classic 5-stage pipeline.
The design supports the base **RV32I** instruction set along with **M-extension** (multiplication and division). It also has a hazard unit for flushing/stalling the pipeline, a forwarding unit to prevent data hazards, and a branch target buffer for branch prediction.

## 🔄 Pipeline Stages

Each stage has its own folder with detailed documentation:

* [Instruction Fetch (IF)](src/fetch_stage/README.md)
* [Instruction Decode (ID)](src/decode_stage/README.md)
* [Execute (EX)](src/execute_stage/README.md)
* [Memory Access (MEM)](src/mem_stage/README.md)
* [Write Back (WB)](src/writeback_stage/README.md)

### Special Notes

* In **IF/ID**, no extra instruction register is needed (instruction memory has 1-cycle latency).
* In **MEM/EX**, no pipeline register for memory result is required (synchronous read provides natural delay).
* **IF/ID** and **ID/EX** pipeline registers support **flush** and **enable** signals from the hazard unit. On flush, all signals turn into a NOP.

---

## 🧩 Supporting Modules

* [Branch Target Buffer (BTB)](src/branch_target_buffer/README.md) – simple branch predictor with update mechanism.
* [M Unit](src/m_unit_extension/README.md) – RV32M extension, hardware multiplier/divider.
* [Forwarding Unit](src/README.md) – resolves data hazards by forwarding from MEM/WB.
* [Hazard Unit](src/README.md) – detects load-use hazards, handles pipeline stalls and flushes.

## ⚡ Performance Improvements

### M-Unit vs Shift-Add Multiply

* Traditional **shift-add multiply/shift-sub divide** requires **32 iterations** for a 32-bit multiply/divide.
* The dedicated **M-unit** executes multiplication in **1 cycles** and for division a maximum of **27 cycle**. This results in a **~20x speedup** for division and **~9x speedup** for multiplication.
* This reduces CPI drastically for multiplication-heavy programs (e.g., matrix multiply).

| Test         | SW Implementation | HW Extension | Improvement | Speedup |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------- |
| Multiply     |        231        |      10      |    95.7 %   |  21.3x  |
| Divide       |        350        |      41      |    88.3 %   |  8.54x  |

See [Mul/Div Tests](tb/README.md#test-categories) for more details

### BTB Speedup

* Without BTB: Every taken branch incurs a **2-cycle penalty**.
* With BTB: Correctly predicted branches avoid stalls. The improvement is workload dependant but on average for different test cases we can observe a **\~20–40%** improvement.

| Test               | Without BTB (Cycles) | With BTB (Cycles) | Improvement |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |------------------ |------------ |
| Forward Branch     |         45           |        33         |    26.7 %   |
| Long Forward Branch|         133          |        77         |    42.1 %   |
| Conditional Branch |         86           |        60         |    30.2 %   |
| Nested Branch      |         147          |        103        |    29.9 %   |
| Alternating Branch |         165          |        129        |    21.8 %   |

## 📊 FPGA Resource Utilization

* The results are Post-Implementation results for Nexys A7 (XC7A100T) at 70MHz.

| Resource        | Utilization |

### ⚡ Power Consumption

* **Dynamic Power:** 0.039 W (due to switching activity during operation)
* **Static Power:** 0.091 W (leakage and idle power)
* **Total Estimated Power:** 0.13 W

💡 *These numbers come from Vivado’s post-implementation power report at 70 MHz.*

## 📜 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TalhaIsrar/RISCV-RV32IM-5-Stage-Pipelined-Processor
   ```
2. Open **ModelSim** or **Vivado** project and add files from `src/` and `tb/`.
3. Compile RISC-V test programs from `programs/` and load them into instruction memory.

## 📊 Test Example
- The processor was tested using a variety of test assembly codes. To further test the processor real life examples were used. These can be found at [Example Programs](programs/tests/examples) with their [Results](imgs/tests/programs). One of these examples is below

### Modular Exponentiation 
For stressing **forwarding, hazards, BTB, and the M-extension**, a **Modular Exponentiation** program is ideal. It involves:

* **Multiplications** → triggers your **M-unit**
* **Conditional branches in loops** → triggers **BTB prediction**
* **Dependent instructions** → triggers **forwarding and hazards**
* **Nested loops and iterative computation** → ensures pipeline stalls occur if not handled

$$
result = (a^b) \mod m
$$

The result is saved in x7 register

### Example Test Numbers:

* Base `a = 7`
* Exponent `b = 13`
* Modulus `m = 20`

**Expected final result**:

$$
7^{13} \mod 20 = 7
$$

## 📌 Future Work

* Support for CSR instructions
* More advanced branch predictors (gshare)
* Memory-mapped I/O support
* UVM-based verification
